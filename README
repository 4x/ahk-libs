All the (redistributable) AHK libs I can find...
Licenses are scattered around in there somewhere.
At the moment, this repo contains well over 200 libraries, classes, and
wrappers for AHK basic (vanilla), AHK_L, and AHK v2, implemented in over
2100 ahk scripts.

Please note that, because this repo makes heavy use of git 'submodules',
downloading a zip or tarball is not useful. Instead, please clone the
repo if you wish to have access to all included libs.

do not want it to be, I apologize. Please just let me know, and I will
remove it.
